### Hi there 👋

I'm a recovering SysAdmin/DevOps engineer after working in the IT industry for 20 years. At the beginning of 2019 I switched careers to Cinematography/Photography after falling in love with all things to do with cameras. In early 2020 I became primarily bedbound due to chronic illness. I now split my time between health recovery, learning new things, content creation, and working on various projects.

I enjoy creative pursuits. For most of my life this has been tinkering with programing and electronics, though I have picked up some basic woodworking, leatherworking and other DIY skills along the way. I also tend to enjoy games that involve some sort of crafting aspect which probably explains why I love Minecraft so much.

I currently run a Minecraft server with a few friends and some of us occasionally stream or YouTube our shenanigans. Feel free to DM me if you would like to know more.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building and maintaining a Minecraft server and community while battling a severe cronic illness.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unreal Engine, Blender, Reaper, and improving my knowlage of DaVinci Resolve. I want to learn Rust for embedded hardware and web application development.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on video content creation and on building tools of use to content creators.
- 💬 Ask me about Docker and Linux. This was my bread and butter for many years and I still enjoy tinkering with it in my spare time.
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm prety easy to find. Just google my name and you'll find me. I'll post links below soon.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm originally from Durban, South Africa but moved to Cape Town in October 2014.

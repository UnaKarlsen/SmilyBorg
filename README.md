### Hi there 👋

I'm a recovering SysAdmin/DevOps engineer after working in the IT industry for 20 years. At the beginning of 2019 I switched careers to Cinematography/Photography after falling in love with all things to do with cameras. In early 2020 I became primarily bedbound due to chronic illness. I now split my time between health recovery, learning new things, content creation, and working on various projects.

I enjoy creative pursuits. For most of my life this has been tinkering with programing and electronics, though I have picked up some basic woodworking, leatherworking and other DIY skills along the way. I also tend to enjoy games that involve some sort of crafting aspect which probably explains why I love Minecraft so much.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on some hobby electronics projects while battling a severe cronic illness.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust for embedded hardware development.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on building a Sigrok driver for the Analog discovery 2.
- 💬 Ask me about Docker and Linux. This was my bread and butter for many years and I still enjoy tinkering with it in my spare time.
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm prety easy to find. Just google my name and you'll find me. I'll post links below soon.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm originally from Durban, South Africa but moved to Cape Town in October 2014.

### Hi there 👋

I'm a recovering SysAdmin/DevOps engineer after working in the  IT industry for 20 years. At the beginning of 2019 I switched careers to Cinematography/Photography after falling in love with all things to do with cameras.

I enjoy creative pursuits. For most of my life this has been tinkering with programing and electronics, though I have picked up some basic woodworking, leatherworking and other DIY skills along the way. I also tend to enjoy games that involve some sort of crafting aspect which probably explains why I love Minecraft so much. These days Minecraft and Elite Dangerous are my main games, but I also enjoy RPGs and anything that has a crafting aspect. I also recently picked up the Command and Conquer remaster for nostalgia purposes and it was so worth it.

I currently run a Minecraft server with a few friends and some of us occasionally stream or YouTube our shenanigans. Feel free to DM me if you would like to know more.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building and maintaining a Minecraft server and community while battling a severe cronic illness.
